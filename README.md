challenge assignment for unit 9 - SQL

As a new engineer at my company, I've been asked to reasearch people who were employeed during the 1980s & 1990s
In order to do this, I designed tables to hold the employee data that was contained in 6 CSV files

Analysis that was requested & conducted on the employee data:
•	List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee

•	List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986

•	List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name

•	List the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name

•	List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B

•	List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name

•	List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name

•	List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name)

Files included as part of the final research include sketch of the table relationships, the table schema file with the definitions for each table
and the sql queries for the table creation & data analysis

Data was imported into the created tables using import/export option in pgAdmin 4
